# Expense Anomaly Detection Proof-of-Concept

## Overview

This repository presents a proof-of-concept for detecting anomalies in expense data. The goal is to identify transactions that deviate significantly from expected patterns, helping to flag potential errors or suspicious activities for further human review. The approach leverages statistical methods and machine learning models to analyze expense distributions and detect outliers.

## Future Improvements

- **Refinement of Anomaly Detection Criteria:** Improve detection accuracy by fine-tuning thresholds and incorporating domain-specific insights.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Develop a dashboard to visualize anomalies and facilitate non-technical user interaction.
